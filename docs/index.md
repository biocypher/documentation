# BioCypher Ecosystem Documentation

Welcome to the unified documentation for the BioCypher ecosystem.
Our mission is to facilitate research, particularly in biology and medicine, by streamlining the scientific workflow.
We do this by providing a suite of tools that help manage knowledge in various ways.
